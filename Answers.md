1. What problem does the context API help solve?

It helps pass data around an application without having to tie it through multiple levels

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

actions - simplify your code by making specific/custom tasks easy to use and reference

reducers -it makes it easier to manage your state and data by having all your state changes in one pure location/format

store - a box that holds all your state and gets passed into components only when it specifically needs to (imagine a bunch of ballons in a pool. If you want a balloon to have water in it, you poke a hole in that one specifically. the pool is the store)

3. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

App state = global state. everything can and will access everything
comp state = local state. only access what has been connected and needs to be accessed.
Best use cases: App State for small applications/pages where it doesnt actually matter. Comp State for bigger applications where accessing too much data can have adverse effects.

4. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

It lets you call functions instead of only objects. makes it easier to write code that actually does something for you. AUTOMATION ðŸŽ‰

5. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

Redux. Its somewhat easier to understand than context. I dont have another reason.
Less headache = happy Key
